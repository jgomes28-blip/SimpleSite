# Google Drive Hosting Instructions

Since Google Drive doesn't directly host HTML files, here's the best way to share your site:

## Quick Method: Share Files Directly

1. **Upload all files to Google Drive**:
   - Go to Google Drive
   - Create a new folder called "Study Guide Generator"
   - Upload these files:
     - `index.html`
     - `styles.css`
     - `script.js`
     - `README.md` (optional)

2. **Make the folder public**:
   - Right-click the folder → **Share**
   - Click **"Change to anyone with the link"**
   - Set permission to **"Viewer"**
   - Click **"Done"**

3. **Get the shareable link**:
   - Right-click `index.html` → **Share**
   - Copy the link
   - Change the end of the URL from `view?usp=sharing` to `preview`
   
   Example:
   ```
   https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing
   ```
   Change to:
   ```
   https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/preview
   ```

4. **Share this link** with your teacher

**Note**: This will open the HTML file in Google Drive's preview, which works but may have some limitations.

## Better Method: Use Google Sites

1. **Go to**: https://sites.google.com
2. **Click "Create"** → **"New site"**
3. **Name it**: "Study Guide Generator"
4. **Click the "+" button** → **"Embed"**
5. **Upload your files to Google Drive** (make them public)
6. **Get the direct link** to your `index.html` file
7. **Paste the link** in the embed code section
8. **Click "Publish"** in the top right
9. **Share the Google Sites URL** with your teacher

## Best Method: GitHub Pages (Recommended)

Your site is already on GitHub! Just enable GitHub Pages:

1. Go to: https://github.com/jgomes28-blip/SimpleSite/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", select: **Branch: main**, **Folder: / (root)**
3. Click **Save**
4. Wait 1-2 minutes
5. Your site will be live at: **https://jgomes28-blip.github.io/SimpleSite/**

This is the best option because:
- ✅ Works perfectly (no limitations)
- ✅ Professional URL
- ✅ Updates automatically
- ✅ Free forever

## For Your Teacher

**If they specifically need Google Drive:**
- Share the Google Drive folder link (Method 1 above)
- Or share the Google Sites link (Method 2 above)

**If they're flexible:**
- Use GitHub Pages (Method 3) - it's the most professional option
